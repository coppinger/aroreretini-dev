## Bookstop

### Speedrun your morning routine

For years, I’ve struggled with consitently following a routine in the
mornings. As someone diagnosed with an executive function disorder,
routines are tricky things indeed.

One day, I had an idea: what if I created a list of tasks, then benchmarked
how long it took me to complete them, individually and cumulatively. My arm-chair
psychology hypothesis was that it’d make the routine much more dopaminergic.

Well, two years later, I have a (somewhat) functional proof-of-concept: Bookstop.
It’s written entirely in vanilla Javascript, so it’s a bit rough around the
edges, but it’s allowed me to test the efficacy of the method, and n=1, it’s
been highly effective!
